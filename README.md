# 1D-convection-diffusion

This module implements FVM on the 1D steady state convection-diffusion equation
with 3 discretisation schemes: 
    
        -Central Differencing 
        -Upwind Differencing 
        -Power-Law Differencing 
        
The resulting system of equations is solved by TDMA.
